# Discord Poker Bot

This bot simulates Texas Hold'em for Discord through a series of commands and allows users within channels to gain and hold chips. It is based off of a fork of [discord-poker-bot](https://github.com/kimjeff49/discord-poker-bot). 

This repo is currently being used as a node tutorial for my son. Any substantive improvements to the [discord-poker-bot](https://github.com/kimjeff49/discord-poker-bot) will be back-ported to the original fork. 

## Requirements

- [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/)
- [Discord](https://discordapp.com/) account
